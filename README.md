# TetrisGenetic

TetrisGenetic is a project that utilizes a genetic algorithm to find approximate solutions to optimization and search problems in the game of Tetris. The genetic algorithm is inspired by the process of natural selection and genetics, making it a powerful search heuristic.

## Description

TetrisGenetic aims to develop effective strategies for playing Tetris using a genetic algorithm. The goal is to find optimal or near-optimal solutions by iteratively generating and evaluating different combinations of moves.

The genetic algorithm starts by creating an initial population of random Tetris game configurations. Each configuration represents a potential solution or strategy. These configurations are then evaluated based on their performance using a fitness function that measures how well they perform in the game.

Using the principles of natural selection, the algorithm selects the top-performing configurations from the population and applies genetic operators such as crossover and mutation to create new offspring configurations. This process mimics the idea of reproduction and evolution, where better-performing configurations have a higher chance of producing successful offspring.

The new offspring configurations replace the less fit members of the population, and the process repeats for several generations. Over time, the population evolves, and the algorithm converges towards better and better solutions.

## Features

- Genetic algorithm-based approach: TetrisGenetic utilizes a genetic algorithm to optimize Tetris gameplay strategies.
- Automatic generation and evaluation: The algorithm automatically generates and evaluates different game configurations to find the best solutions.
- Fitness function: A fitness function is employed to measure the performance of each configuration and guide the evolution process.
- Genetic operators: Crossover and mutation are used as genetic operators to create new offspring configurations and introduce diversity into the population.
- Iterative process: The algorithm iteratively evolves the population by selecting the fittest individuals and generating new generations.
- Configurable parameters: Users can customize parameters such as population size, mutation rate, and selection criteria to fine-tune the algorithm.
- Visualization and analysis: TetrisGenetic provides visualization and analysis tools to observe the progress and results of the algorithm.
